### Bikeshare project

### Description

This project was created to look at data provided by Motivate, a bikeshare system provider for many cities in the United States, for these three cities: chicago, new york city, washington

I created an interactive program for users using python that analyzes the data and provides the following statistics:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

-most common month
-most common day of week
-most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

-most common start station
-most common end station
-most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

-total travel time
-average travel time

#4 User info

-counts of each user type
-counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
-earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
List of files used includes: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

Python code is found in bikeshare.py
